/*
  An abstract fixpoint solver based on Constraint Programming

  Example file from Leopold Haller's benchmark
  Simple Taylor expansion of sine, no loop

  =>
  can prove a bound of 1.05 for the output
  We wanted to illustrate that it works for tighter bounds

  the vertical bar for out=0 is expected (the inductive invariant must
  include both the init state, where out=0, and the end state, where
  out is the approximate sine)
